                      <p>Welcome to the LDS Scripture Citation Index.  This index, found on the right side of your browser window,
                      links from scriptures to the general conference talks, <i>Journal of Discourses</i> speeches, and
                      writings in <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i> that cite those
                      scriptures.&nbsp; So, for example, suppose you want to know who has cited
                      1&nbsp;Ne.&nbsp;3:7 in general conference; tap on the First Nephi button
                      followed by the 1&nbsp;Ne.&nbsp;3 button; there you'll find the answer.&nbsp;
                      Who has quoted Matt.&nbsp;5:48?&nbsp; Use the New Testament index to find out.</p>

                      <p>The panel on the left side of your browser lets you read the scriptures, including
                      the King James Version and Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, the Book of Mormon,
                      Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.  This is not the official
                      LDS version of the standard works.  Go to <a href="http://lds.org/scriptures">LDS.org/scriptures</a>
                      for the official publication.  Among the differences between this version and the Church's official
                      version are that we do not include their footnotes, chapter summaries, and study helps
                      such as the Bible Dictionary and Topical Guide.</p>

                      <p>We have indexed the scriptures cited by speakers in LDS General Conference
                      between 1942 and the present, and those cited by speakers recorded in the
                      <i>Journal of Discourses</i> between 1839 and 1886.&nbsp; The citations in
                      <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i> come from the special edition,
                      <i>Scriptural Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, edited by Richard C.
                      Galbraith and published by Deseret Book in 1993 (ISBN 0875796478).</p>

                      <p>To begin, click on one of the books and chapters in the index and you'll see
                      a list of references for verses in that chapter.&nbsp; A reference looks like
                      this: <b>2 Pet. 1:4</b>.  When you select the <b>2 Pet. 1:4</b> item, you will see
                      a list of citations for 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 4.  Citations occur in three forms.

                      </p><p><b>1. General Conference:</b></p>

                      text on the second line.  The icons labeled Watch and Listen take you to LDS.org for a video or audio
                      presentation of the talk.  Audio and video are available for more recent conference talks, but not for
                      older talks.</p>

                      right column), “Brigham Young” is the speaker name, and the discourse
                      title appears in smaller text on the second line.</p>

                      <p>In general conference talks, <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, and <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>,
                      synchronization arrows (<img src="./about_files/sync_17@2x.png" width="22" height="17">)
                      appear to the left of each scriptural reference.  Clicking on these arrows

                      Within each marker are two icons.  The left icon (<img src="./about_files/pdf_17.png" width="14" height="17">)

                      This web site uses the open-source Lucene search engine, so queries use the Lucene
                      syntax, which is a lot like Google's.  Here are few sample queries you might try:<p></p>
                      <table>
                      <tbody><tr><th>Search Terms</th><th>Finds Documents …</th></tr>
                      <tr><td>angels stand sentinels</td><td>Finds documents containing any combination of these words.</td></tr>
                      <tr><td>+angels +stand +sentinels</td><td>Finds documents containing all three words.</td></tr>
                      <tr><td>-angels +sentinels</td><td>Finds documents containing “sentinels” but not “angels”.</td></tr>
                      <tr><td>“angels sentinels”~10</td><td>Finds documents where “sentinels” is separated from “angels” by at most 10 words.</td></tr>
                      <tr><td>“angels who stand”</td><td>Finds documents containing the exact phrase “angels who stand”.</td></tr>
                      <tr><td>+Uchtdorf +hope</td><td>Finds all talks from President Uchtdorf including the word
                      “hope”. Note that this actually finds all documents that include
                      the words “Uchtdorf” and “hope”, but most often
                      documents containing the word “Uchtdorf” are his talks.</td></tr>
                      <tr><td>angel*s</td><td>Finds documents containing any word starting with “angel” and ending with “s”
                      (e.g., “angels”, “Angeles”). The <b>*</b> wildcard matches any
                      combination of 0 or more letters.</td></tr>
                      <tr><td>s?nd</td><td>Finds documents containing any 4-letter word starting with “s” and ending with
                      “nd” (e.g., “sand”, “send”). The <b>?</b> wildcard matches exactly
                      one letter.</td></tr>
                      </tbody></table>
                      <p>Searches are case insensitive. The <b>*</b> wildcard may not appear as the first letter of a search
                      term, and both <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> wildcards may not be used in phrase and proximity searches.
                      For example, the queries “angel*s stand”~5
                      and “s?nd here” both will produce no results.</p>

                      <p>Our search facility lets you search either the talks (including <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>,
                      <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, and talks from General Conference since 1942) or the scriptures.  When searching
                      talks, by default we sort the results according to relevance, meaning that talks that use the search terms
                      most appear earlier in the results list.  You can change this to sort by date by unchecking the box next
                      to "Sort by Relevance", and the results list will be sorted by date (most recent talk first).  You can
                      also limit the search to a specific speaker and/or to a range of years, and you can choose which sets of
                      talks to search (i.e. General Conference, <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, or <i>Teachings</i>).</p>

                      <p>When searching scriptures, the default order for the results list is by order within the standard works
                      (<i>Old Testament</i>, <i>New Testament</i>, <i>Book of Mormon</i>, <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i>, and
                      <i>Pearl of Great Price</i>).  If you check the box next to "Sort by Relevance", the results list will be
                      presented in order of relevance, meaning verses that have search terms as a higher percentage of the verse
                      will appear earlier in the results.  You can also choose which specific volumes to search.  Selecting "Joseph
                      Smith Translation" tells the system to search for JST verses that are footnoted in the LDS edition of the
                      Bible.  However, if you deselect Old Testament and New Testament but select "Joseph Smith Translation", then
                      the system will search all verses of the JST, not just the LDS footnoted verses.</p>

                          <p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; The proceedings of the April 1943 conference
                          were published in the May, June, and July issues of the 1943 Improvement
                          Era due to a wartime paper shortage.&nbsp; The October 1957 conference was
                          canceled due to an epidemic of Asian flu in the United States.&nbsp; Elder
                          Harold B. Lee's priesthood address at the October 1967 conference was
                          published in the January 1968 issue of the Improvement Era, pages 26-31.
                          Also, in our index, page numbers for conference addresses between 1942 and 1970
                          reference the Conference Reports due to the scarcity of Improvement Era magazines.
